# Being a Tech Lead during Practical Agile

_This was originally developed as a conference talk for Nebraska.Code() on July 19, 2024._

In an ideal world, agile software teams smoothly build an incremental product with clearly defined roles and process, but who lives in an ideal world?

In practice, agile software teams have to cooperate with non-agile teams, turnover, external responsibilities, and changing needs. How and when do software teams evolve their methodology, such as moving from Scrum to Kanban? How do you manage cross-functional team members on loan from other teams? How do you coordinate with stakeholders that have conflicting goals? How do you transition from initial product development to feature development? How do you deal with inevitable turnover on your team?

While there is no silver bullet to being a tech lead during practical agile, each phase in the lifecycle of a product has goals, mindsets, and practices that guide you toward success.

## Why should you listen to me?

You shouldn't. Every company, every organization, every product is different. Your mileage will certainly vary.

I have been a tech lead, amongst other roles and responsibilities, for 8 years. Most importantly, I've failed many times and learned from my mistakes.
